# Flint

This is the main repository of the Flint project for Amazon Web Services. Flint is a metagenomics profiling pipeline that is built on top of the [Apache Spark][1] framework, and is designed for fast real-time profiling of metagenomic samples against a large collection of reference genomes. Flint takes advantage of Spark's built-in parallelism and streaming engine architecture to quickly map reads against a large reference collection of bacterial genomes.

Our computational framework is primarily implemented using the MapReduce model, and deployed in a cluster launched using the [Elastic Map Reduce][2] service offered by AWS ([Amazon Web Services][3]). The cluster consists of multiple commodity worker machines (computational nodes), and in the current configuration of the cluster that we use, each worker machine consists of 15 GB of RAM, 8 vCPUs (a hyperthread of a single Intel Xeon core), and 100 GB of EBS disk storage. Each of the worker nodes will work in parallel to align the input sequencing DNA reads to a partitioned shard of the reference database; after the alignment step is completed, each worker node acts as a regular Spark executor node.

The current database for running Flint is version 41 from [Ensembl Bacteria][4], but we are currently working on the latest version of [RefSeq][5], which should be available this summer.

## How To Get Started

- [Download the Code][6] and [follow the instructions][7] on how to create an EMR cluster, setup the streaming source, and start Flint.
- Detailed instructions, as well as a manual and reference, can be found at the [projectâ€™s website][8].

## Communication

- If you **found a bug**, open an issue and _please provide detailed steps to reliably reproduce it_.
- If you have **feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **would like to contribute**, please submit a pull request.

## Requirements
Flint is designed to run on [Apache Spark][9], but the current implementation is tuned for Amazon's EMR [Elastic Map Reduce][10]. The basic requrements for an [EMR][11] cluster are:

- [Apache Hadoop][12]
- [Apache Spark][13]
- [Ganglia][14]
- [Hue][15]
- [Hive][16]

The basic requirements for the worker nodes are:

- [Bowtie, v.2.3.4.1][17]
- [Python][18]
- [BioPython][19]
- [Pandas][20]
- [Fabric][21]
- [Boto3][22]
- [csv][23]
- [pathlib2][24]
- [shlex][25]
- [pickle][26]
- [subprocess][27]


### Bowtie2

[Bowtie][28] is required for the aligment step, and needs to be installed in all worker nodes of the Spark Cluster.  See the [Bowtie2 manual][29] for more information.

### Python Packages

The remaining requirements are python packages that Flint needs for a successfull run, please refer to the package's documentation for instructions and/or installation instructions.
